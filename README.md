# DSL-Power-Cycle
A little script to ping something and if it can't then cycle a relay to reboot something.

This script will ping an address.  
If that address doesn't answer it will trigger a relay for a short pierod of time to reboot something like a DSL router.

It also includes pins that it will turn on to display lights telling you the status of the system.  Intended to be red, yellow and green.
